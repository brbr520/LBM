# Just an input file for my un-named LBM solver. At the moment (2/15/2012),
# all fields are required and the parser does not give any errors when there
# are missing fields. On the other hand, this parser is pretty cool because
# it understands comment lines, like this one, blank lines, and is not bound
# to a certain keyword order. I think I'm most proud of this piece of code.
